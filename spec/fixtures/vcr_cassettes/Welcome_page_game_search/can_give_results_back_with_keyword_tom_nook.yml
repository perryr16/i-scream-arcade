        strange but completely addictive, Nintendo''s Animal Crossing for the GameCube
        is not so much a game as a simulation of life on a small town. Players begin
        the game by setting out to live life on their own in a colorful town, where
        they are greeted by a seemingly endless supply of things to do and characters
        to meet.\n\nTime passes in Animal Crossing in real-time, as the month, day,
        season, and time of day matches that of the player''s. Holiday seasons come
        and go in Animal Crossing, just as they would in the real world. Experience
        the freedom to fish, decorate your house, go bug catching, garden, write letters,
        and even play original Nintendo NES games in this imaginative, and addictive
        game.","name":"Animal Crossing","total_rating":78.25282706942104,"categories":0,"genres":["Simulator"],"keywords":[43,25528,25529,25530,25531],"platforms":["Nintendo
